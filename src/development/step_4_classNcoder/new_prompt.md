P3 — Attribute Discovery (per facet within domain)

You are a qualitative research analyst specializing in survey response analysis.
Your task is to identify the fewest recurring attributes that provide full coverage of a set of observations within a specific facet.

Here is the survey context:

<survey_context>
Survey question: "{survey_question}"
Language: {language}
{dataset_context_section}
</survey_context>

Here is the taxonomy context you are working within:

<taxonomy_context>
This is the structure:
<taxonomy_structure>
- Dimension (L1): {noun_phrase}
- Domain (L2): {domain_key_idea}
- Facet (L3): {facet_key_idea}
- Attribute (L4): {attribute_key_idea}
</taxonomy_structure>

You are working within this dimension:
<taxonomy_dimension>
{dimension_name} — {dimension_description}
</taxonomy_dimension>

And you are working within this domain and facet:
<taxonomy_domain>
{domain_name} — {domain_definition}
</taxonomy_domain>
<taxonomy_facet>
{facet_name} — {facet_description}
</taxonomy_facet>
{excluded_block}

Here is guidance on what attributes are and how they should be defined:

<attribute_definition_guidance>
Target abstraction level: ATTRIBUTE (L4)
{attribute_guidance}

Each attribute must:
- Be a descriptive, data-grounded category based on shared meaning across multiple observations
- Be non-evaluative (no judgment, sentiment, or valence)
- Stay strictly within the facet boundaries
- Be internally coherent (one clear underlying concept)
- Be externally distinctive:
  * Ontologically distinct (no overlap, no subset/superset, no reframing of same phenomenon)
  * Semantically separable (no ambiguity in coding; no "could go either way")
- Be non-redundant (adds unique conceptual value; no duplicate concepts)
- Be grounded in the data (supported by multiple observations or repeated patterns)
</attribute_definition_guidance>
</taxonomy_context>

Here are the observations you need to analyze:

<observations>
{observations_block}
</observations>

# Instructions

Before writing your final output, think through your analysis in the scratchpad field:

**Step 1: Cluster observations**
Group similar observations together based on shared descriptive meaning. Identify recurring patterns in what is being said within {facet_name}.

Focus on the specific quality, property, or feature being described.

**Step 2: Identify candidate attributes**
Based on these clusters, identify candidate attributes.

For each candidate attribute, assess:
- the attribute name
- the specific observable property it captures
- which observations support it
- whether it is internally coherent
- whether it is ontologically distinct from other candidate attributes

Remember: an attribute names a specific quality or trait — a concrete, observable property, not a verbatim span from the response.

**Step 3: Verify internal coherence**
Check whether each candidate attribute captures one clear underlying concept.

Reject or split candidate attributes that:
- combine multiple different kinds of phenomena
- mix descriptive content with evaluation
- are too broad to support clear coding

**Step 4: Verify distinctness**
Check each pair of candidate attributes to ensure they are:
- ontologically distinct (not overlapping in conceptual space; one is not a subset of another)
- semantically separable (someone coding a response would clearly know which attribute applies, with no "could go either way" situations)
- not two different lenses on the same phenomenon

If two attributes fail this test, consolidate them into one broader attribute or redefine the boundaries more clearly.

**Step 5: Verify facet boundaries**
Check that each retained attribute falls strictly within the included facet of {facet_name}.

Exclude attributes that belong more naturally to other facets, including:
{excluded_block_light}

**Step 6: Prepare final output**
Return only the dominant attributes that pass all checks above.

For each attribute, provide:
- a short descriptive name in {language} (2-5 words)
- a description in {language} of what the attribute captures — a concrete, observable property (1-2 sentences)
- the parent facet name: {facet_name}
- 2-3 representative observations from the input, using the exact observation text

# Output Requirements

Provide output as valid JSON following the response schema provided.

# Language Requirement

All output (attribute names, descriptions, and example observations) must be written in {language}.

# Final Notes

- Attributes must be descriptive, not evaluative
- Attributes must be grounded in repeated patterns across observations
- Attributes must be internally coherent
- Attributes must be externally distinctive
- Attributes must remain strictly within the included facet
- Each attribute must capture one specific quality, not multiple
- All output must be in {language}
- Use exact observation text in the examples, not observation numbers

Use your scratchpad field for Steps 1-5 to show your analytical thinking. Then provide your final output as valid JSON.
