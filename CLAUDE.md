# CoderingsTool Project Context

## Conversation Summary

This document captures the context and progress from our conversation that began with project initialization and evolved through two major phases of development.

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Cache System Implementation

#### Initial Setup
- **Started:** User requested initialization of CoderingsTool project
- **Key Insight:** User emphasized the importance of presenting plans before implementing (after I initially created files without permission)
- **Language Support:** Corrected to use Dutch as default language with English option for UI
- **Created Files:**
  - README.md - Project documentation
  - requirements.txt - Python dependencies  
  - CLAUDE.md - This context file

#### Cache System Development
- **Problem:** Basic CSV file handling with `if filepath.exists()` checks was unreliable
- **Solution:** Implemented sophisticated SQLite-backed cache system
- **Challenges:** Encountered Windows file locking issues requiring multiple iterations
- **Fix:** Disabled atomic writes on Windows platform specifically
- **Architecture:**
  ```python
  # cache_config.py - Fixed cache directory location
  def get_default_cache_dir():
      src_dir = Path(__file__).parent
      return src_dir.parent / "data" / "cache"  # Use project root, not src
  ```
  ```python
  # cache_manager.py - Platform-specific atomic writes
  import platform
  use_atomic = self.config.use_atomic_writes and platform.system() != 'Windows'
  ```

### Phase 2: Clustering System Improvements (Current)

#### User Requirements for Clustering
1. **Only HDBSCAN** - No alternative clustering algorithms
2. **Fully Automatic** - No user parameter tuning required
3. **Default to Description Embeddings** - Not code embeddings
4. **Micro-clusters for Outliers** - Option C from presented choices
5. **No Visualizations** - Quality metrics only
6. **Preserve Core Logic** - Add enhancements on top, don't change existing clustering

#### TODO List Created and Progress
1. **Simplify ClusteringConfig for Automatic Mode** ‚úì COMPLETED
   - Removed manual parameter options
   - Added embedding_type with default "description"
   - Added quality thresholds for automatic decisions
   - Kept only user-relevant options

2. **Implement Quality Metrics Module** ‚úì COMPLETED
   - Created cluster_quality.py with test section
   - Calculates silhouette score, noise ratio, mean cluster size
   - Combined quality score with weighted components:
     ```python
     weights = {
         'silhouette': 0.4,
         'coverage': 0.3,
         'noise': 0.3  # Negative weight
     }
     ```

3. **Update Clusterer for Automatic Mode** ‚úì COMPLETED
   - Added config integration without changing core logic
   - Quality metrics calculation after clustering
   - Retry mechanism with parameter adjustment if quality < 0.7
   - Micro-clustering for outliers if noise ratio > 9%
   - Test section at bottom for validation

4. **Add Pipeline Integration** ‚è≥ PENDING
   - Add command-line arguments for clustering options
   - Save quality metrics to cache database
   - Add success/failure reporting to user

5. **Test and Refine** ‚è≥ PENDING
   - Test with different datasets  
   - Adjust automatic parameter selection
   - Fine-tune quality thresholds

#### Key Implementation Details

**ClusteringConfig (clustering_config.py):**
```python
@dataclass
class ClusteringConfig:
    embedding_type: str = "description"  # User default preference
    language: str = "nl"                 # Dutch default
    min_quality_score: float = 0.3       # Minimum acceptable quality
    max_noise_ratio: float = 0.5         # Maximum acceptable noise
```

**Clusterer Updates (clusterer.py):**
- Added config to constructor: `__init__(self, config: ClusteringConfig = None)`
- Automatic parameter selection based on data size
- Quality evaluation after clustering
- Retry mechanism: "If quality is below 0.7, retry with adjusted parameters"
- Micro-clustering: "If noise ratio exceeds 9%, create micro-clusters from outliers"

### Testing Strategy
User explicitly requested: "And after you have done this, we will test clusterer.py. And if it does we will proceed with further refinement."

Current testing approach:
1. Complete implementation of current TODO
2. Test before proceeding to next TODO
3. Get user confirmation before major changes

### Current Status
- ‚úì Completed Phase 2: Clustering Improvements
- ‚úì Successfully tested automatic clustering with excellent results
- ‚úì Quality metrics working correctly (0.881 quality score achieved)
- ‚úì Pipeline integration completed with CLI arguments and metrics database
- ‚úì Pipeline successfully runs steps 1-5
- üîú Next: Phase 3 - Improve labeling system (step 6)

### Files Modified in Phase 2
1. `/workspaces/CoderingsTool/src/modules/utils/clustering_config.py` - NEW
2. `/workspaces/CoderingsTool/src/modules/utils/cluster_quality.py` - NEW

6. `/workspaces/CoderingsTool/src/cache_manager.py` - UPDATED (metrics methods)
7. `/workspaces/CoderingsTool/CLAUDE.md` - UPDATED

### Key Principles Established
1. **Always present plans before implementing**
2. **Dutch as default language throughout system**
3. **Test incrementally before proceeding**
4. **Keep existing logic intact, add enhancements on top**
5. **Focus on automatic operation without user parameter tuning**

```

#### Testing clusterer.py Standalone

To test the updated clusterer in Spyder:

1. **Navigate to the correct directory:**
   ```python
   cd /workspaces/CoderingsTool/src/modules/utils/
   ```

2. **Run clusterer.py directly:**
   ```python
   python clusterer.py
   ```

3. **Or run in Spyder:**
   - Open clusterer.py in Spyder
   - The test section at the bottom will run automatically when you execute the file
   - It will:
     - Load embeddings from cache
     - Create a default ClusteringConfig (description embeddings, Dutch)
     - Run the clustering pipeline
     - Display quality metrics
     - Save results to cache
     - Show cluster summaries

4. **What to look for:**
   - Quality metrics output (silhouette score, noise ratio, etc.)
   - Overall quality score (should be between 0 and 1)
   - Number of meta-clusters found
   - The clustering parameters that were automatically selected
   - Any retry attempts if quality was below 0.7

5. **Customizing the test:**
   You can modify the test section to use different settings:
   ```python
   # Use code embeddings instead of descriptions
   config = ClusteringConfig(embedding_type="code")
   
   # Use English language
   config = ClusteringConfig(language="en")
   ```

```

### Current TODO: Create Fresh Labeller from Scratch

**Status: Redesigning labeller with optimized architecture**

#### Step 1: Aligned Objective and Output ‚úì COMPLETED

**Objective**
The labeller should analyze clustered survey responses and create a hierarchical labeling system that:
1. Provides meaningfully differentiated and mutually exclusive labels for clusters
2. Creates a 3-level hierarchy of labels (Theme/Topic/Code)
3. Keeps track of how merged and new labels (Theme/Topic/Code) can be mapped back to the initial clusters provided by clusterer
4. Merges labels that are not meaningfully differentiated
5. Writes a summary for each theme, explaining how each theme addresses the research question

**Input (from models.py)**
- `var_lab`: str - The survey question being analyzed
- `cluster_results`: List[models.ClusterModel] - The clustered survey responses
  - `respondent_id`: Identifier for the respondent
  - `response`: Original response text
  - `response_segment`: List[ClusterSubmodel] with:
    - Segment details (ID, text, embeddings)
    - `segment_response`: str - response segments
    - `descriptive_code`: str - a descriptive code given to each response segment
    - `code_description`: str - a description of the code, explaining how the code addresses the research question

**Output (to models.py)**
- `label_results`: List[models.LabelModel] - Each containing:
  - `respondent_id`: Identifier for the respondent
  - `response`: Original response text
  - `response_segment`: List[LabelSubmodel] with:
    - Segment details (ID, text, embeddings)
    - Hierarchical labels:
      - `Theme`: High-level category (meta) = level-1 node
      - `Topic`: Mid-level category (meso) = level-2 node  
      - `Code`: Detailed category (micro) = level-3 node
    - Cluster assignments
  - `summary`: Response summary

**Key Deliverables**
1. Hierarchical label structure with meaningful differentiation
2. Mapping table from original clusters to final labels
3. Theme summaries explaining relevance to research question

#### Step 2: Strategy ‚úì COMPLETED

**Guiding Principles**
1. Develop robust code - write modular code, work with structured models including the labeller (see models.py), validate input and output of models (use pydantic) and prompts for LLMs have a response format (use instructor)
2. Adhere to previous code - build classes for each phase, including the labeller
3. Be efficient and quick - batch and run batches async with asyncio if possible

**Job to be Done**
We segmented responses to a survey question and clustered these segments by their code descriptions, particularly: embeddings of these description with HBDscan. We did not constrain segmentation with HBDscan, so we have many clusters. Some of the clusters are not meaningfully differentiated from the viewpoint of the research question. Our task is to merge initial clusters that are not meaningfully differentiated, after which we organise these merged clusters in a 3-level hierarchy. Themes = level-1 node; Topics=level-2 node; Codes= level-3 node. The merged clusters are level-3 node. In completing this job, we cannot lose track of how the merged and new clusters can be mapped back on the original clusters given to us by the clusterer.

**Overall Workflow**

The labeller will follow a multi-phase approach to create hierarchical labels:

1. **Phase 1: Initial Label Generation**
   - Extract descriptive codes and descriptions from clusters
   - Generate initial labels for each cluster using LLM

2. **Phase 2: Merge initial clusters that are not meaningfully differentiated**
   - Merge initial clusters with super high cosine similarity of embeddings (label+most representative descriptive codes and code descriptions. Auto-merge >0.95 similarity)
   - Use LLM to score the similarity of the remaining clusters. This needs to be done as efficiently as possible.
   - Apply semantic merging of the remaining clusters to create differentiated labels
   - Track cluster-to-label mappings throughout

3. **Phase 3: Hierarchical Organization**
   - Organize merged clusters into 3-level hierarchy
   - Ensure meaningful differentiation at each level
   - Validate mutual exclusivity within levels

4. **Phase 4: Theme Summarization**
   - Generate summaries for each theme
   - Explain how each theme addresses the research question
   - Finalize the hierarchical structure

**Optimization Strategies**

1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Async LLM calls with concurrency limits
   - Batch processing of clusters (10-20 at a time)
   - Embedding-based pre-filtering to reduce LLM calls
   - Caching for repeated operations

2. **Quality Optimizations**
   - Use centroid embeddings for representative sampling
   - LLM scoring for merging decisions
   - Iterative refinement of labels
   - Context-aware prompting with var_lab

3. **Architecture Patterns**
   - Async/await throughout
   - Configurable settings class
   - Structured data models for each phase
   - Clear separation of concerns

#### Step 3: Architecture Inspiration ‚úì COMPLETED

**Key Architectural Patterns from Existing Code**

Based on examination of `segmentDescriber.py`, `embedder.py` and `models.py`:

1. **Class Structure**
   - Main class with configuration in `__init__`
   - Use of config parameters with defaults
   - Clear separation of sync and async methods
   - Builder pattern for complex chains (LangChain)

2. **Async Patterns**
   - Use `AsyncOpenAI` client for async operations
   - `async def` for methods that perform I/O
   - `await` for async calls
   - `asyncio.run()` to run async methods from sync context
   - Batch processing with concurrency control
   - Retry logic for resilience

3. **Data Models (Pydantic)**
   - Inherit from appropriate base models
   - Use `Optional` for nullable fields
   - `ConfigDict(arbitrary_types_allowed=True)` for numpy arrays
   - Clear hierarchy: Base ‚Üí Submodel ‚Üí Model
   - Type hints throughout

4. **LLM Integration**
   - Use `instructor` library for structured output
   - Patch OpenAI client: `instructor.from_openai(AsyncOpenAI())`
   - Response models with Pydantic
   - Error handling and retries
   - Token management for batching

5. **Batch Processing**

     "You are tasked with comparing clusters based on their labels and most representative 
     descriptive codes and code descriptions. Please give a score from 0 to 1 for how 
     similar they are from the point of view of addressing the research question.
     
     0 = maximally differentiated
     0.5 = pretty similar, probably sharing an overarching theme or response pattern
     1 = not positively differentiated at all, there is no difference or the difference 
         does not help in any way to explain how respondents answered the research 
         question differently"
     ```
   - Merge threshold: 0.7
   - Simple, research question-focused

**Key Design Decisions**
- Keep it simple, don't overcomplicate
- Focus on research question relevance
- Use 0-1 similarity scale with clear meanings
- Write prompts in prompts.py when needed

#### Step 5: Implementation ‚úì COMPLETED

**Created Files**
1. `labeller.py` - Main labeller class with orchestration logic
2. `phase1_labeller.py` - Initial label generation
3. `phase2_merger.py` - Similarity analysis and merging
4. `phase3_organizer.py` - Hierarchical organization
5. `phase4_summarizer.py` - Theme summarization
6. Added new prompts to `prompts.py`
7. `test_labeller.py` - Test script for validation

**Key Features Implemented**
- Async processing throughout with configurable concurrency
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Embedding-based pre-filtering for similarity (>0.95)
- LLM-based similarity scoring with 0.7 merge threshold
- 3-level hierarchy (Theme/Topic/Code)
- Cluster tracking and mapping throughout
- Theme summaries explaining research question relevance
- Robust error handling and retries
- Progress tracking with tqdm

**Architecture Highlights**
- Follows established patterns from other modules
- Pydantic models for all data structures
- Instructor for structured LLM outputs
- Clear separation of concerns by phase
- Configurable settings
- JSON response format for all LLM calls

**Testing**
Run the test script to validate:
```bash
cd /workspaces/CoderingsTool/src/modules/utils
python test_labeller.py
```

### Future Phases
1. Phase 4: Complete labeller optimization (current priority)
2. Phase 5: Add retry mechanisms for LLM calls
3. Phase 6: Implement results display (step 7)
4. Phase 7: Add data visualization
5. Phase 8: Create export options
6. Phase 9: Add multilingual support beyond Dutch/English

## Environment Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable required
- Hunspell dictionaries for Dutch and English

## Testing Notes
- Pipeline can run end-to-end but outputs need verification
- Steps 5 and 6 produce results but quality needs improvement
- No visualization of results yet

## Important Context for Development
- This is an active work in progress
- Core pipeline exists but needs refinement
- UI is set up but not connected to all pipeline functions
- Focus should be on improving existing steps before adding new features

## Current Focus: Simplified Clustering and Smart Labeling
- Simplified clusterer with hardcoded parameters (Phase 3)
- Single-pass clustering with quality metrics for display only
- Labeller handles all semantic intelligence
- LLM-based cluster merging based on semantic similarity
- Domain context derived from var_lab
- Pipeline runs steps 1-5 successfully, step 6 being improved
