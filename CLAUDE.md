# CoderingsTool Project Context

## Conversation Summary

This document captures the context and progress from our conversation that began with project initialization and evolved through two major phases of development.

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Cache System Implementation

#### Initial Setup
- **Started:** User requested initialization of CoderingsTool project
- **Key Insight:** User emphasized the importance of presenting plans before implementing (after I initially created files without permission)
- **Language Support:** Corrected to use Dutch as default language with English option for UI
- **Created Files:**
  - README.md - Project documentation
  - requirements.txt - Python dependencies  
  - CLAUDE.md - This context file

#### Cache System Development
- **Problem:** Basic CSV file handling with `if filepath.exists()` checks was unreliable
- **Solution:** Implemented sophisticated SQLite-backed cache system
- **Challenges:** Encountered Windows file locking issues requiring multiple iterations
- **Fix:** Disabled atomic writes on Windows platform specifically
- **Architecture:**
  ```python
  # cache_config.py - Fixed cache directory location
  def get_default_cache_dir():
      src_dir = Path(__file__).parent
      return src_dir.parent / "data" / "cache"  # Use project root, not src
  ```
  ```python
  # cache_manager.py - Platform-specific atomic writes
  import platform
  use_atomic = self.config.use_atomic_writes and platform.system() != 'Windows'
  ```

### Phase 2: Clustering System Improvements (Current)

#### User Requirements for Clustering
1. **Only HDBSCAN** - No alternative clustering algorithms
2. **Fully Automatic** - No user parameter tuning required
3. **Default to Description Embeddings** - Not code embeddings
4. **Micro-clusters for Outliers** - Option C from presented choices
5. **No Visualizations** - Quality metrics only
6. **Preserve Core Logic** - Add enhancements on top, don't change existing clustering

#### TODO List Created and Progress
1. **Simplify ClusteringConfig for Automatic Mode** ✓ COMPLETED
   - Removed manual parameter options
   - Added embedding_type with default "description"
   - Added quality thresholds for automatic decisions
   - Kept only user-relevant options

2. **Implement Quality Metrics Module** ✓ COMPLETED
   - Created cluster_quality.py with test section
   - Calculates silhouette score, noise ratio, mean cluster size
   - Combined quality score with weighted components:
     ```python
     weights = {
         'silhouette': 0.4,
         'coverage': 0.3,
         'noise': 0.3  # Negative weight
     }
     ```

3. **Update Clusterer for Automatic Mode** ✓ COMPLETED
   - Added config integration without changing core logic
   - Quality metrics calculation after clustering
   - Retry mechanism with parameter adjustment if quality < 0.7
   - Micro-clustering for outliers if noise ratio > 9%
   - Test section at bottom for validation

4. **Add Pipeline Integration** ⏳ PENDING
   - Add command-line arguments for clustering options
   - Save quality metrics to cache database
   - Add success/failure reporting to user

5. **Test and Refine** ⏳ PENDING
   - Test with different datasets  
   - Adjust automatic parameter selection
   - Fine-tune quality thresholds

#### Key Implementation Details

**ClusteringConfig (clustering_config.py):**
```python
@dataclass
class ClusteringConfig:
    embedding_type: str = "description"  # User default preference
    language: str = "nl"                 # Dutch default
    min_quality_score: float = 0.3       # Minimum acceptable quality
    max_noise_ratio: float = 0.5         # Maximum acceptable noise
```

**Clusterer Updates (clusterer.py):**
- Added config to constructor: `__init__(self, config: ClusteringConfig = None)`
- Automatic parameter selection based on data size
- Quality evaluation after clustering
- Retry mechanism: "If quality is below 0.7, retry with adjusted parameters"
- Micro-clustering: "If noise ratio exceeds 9%, create micro-clusters from outliers"

### Testing Strategy
User explicitly requested: "And after you have done this, we will test clusterer.py. And if it does we will proceed with further refinement."

Current testing approach:
1. Complete implementation of current TODO
2. Test before proceeding to next TODO
3. Get user confirmation before major changes

### Current Status
- ✓ Completed Phase 2: Clustering Improvements
- ✓ Successfully tested automatic clustering with excellent results
- ✓ Quality metrics working correctly (0.881 quality score achieved)
- Pipeline integration (TODO #4) is next priority
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing code

### Files Modified in Phase 2
1. `/workspaces/CoderingsTool/src/modules/utils/clustering_config.py` - NEW
2. `/workspaces/CoderingsTool/src/modules/utils/cluster_quality.py` - NEW
3. `/workspaces/CoderingsTool/src/modules/utils/clusterer.py` - UPDATED
4. `/workspaces/CoderingsTool/CLAUDE.md` - UPDATED

### Key Principles Established
1. **Always present plans before implementing**
2. **Dutch as default language throughout system**
3. **Test incrementally before proceeding**
4. **Keep existing logic intact, add enhancements on top**
5. **Focus on automatic operation without user parameter tuning**

### Next Immediate Step
Test the current clusterer implementation with the quality metrics and automatic mode before proceeding to TODO #4 (Pipeline Integration).

### Testing Instructions for clusterer.py

To test the updated clusterer in Spyder:

1. **Navigate to the correct directory:**
   ```python
   cd /workspaces/CoderingsTool/src/modules/utils/
   ```

2. **Run clusterer.py directly:**
   ```python
   python clusterer.py
   ```

3. **Or run in Spyder:**
   - Open clusterer.py in Spyder
   - The test section at the bottom will run automatically when you execute the file
   - It will:
     - Load the data from the SPSS file
     - Create a default ClusteringConfig (description embeddings, Dutch)
     - Run the clustering pipeline
     - Display quality metrics
     - Save results to CSV
     - Show cluster summaries

4. **What to look for:**
   - Quality metrics output (silhouette score, noise ratio, etc.)
   - Overall quality score (should be between 0 and 1)
   - Number of meta-clusters found
   - The clustering parameters that were automatically selected
   - Any retry attempts if quality was below 0.7

5. **Customizing the test:**
   You can modify the test section to use different settings:
   ```python
   # Use code embeddings instead of descriptions
   config = ClusteringConfig(embedding_type="code")
   
   # Use English language
   config = ClusteringConfig(language="en")
   ```
